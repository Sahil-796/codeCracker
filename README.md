# CodeCracker

**CodeCracker** is a full-stack web application that lets users track their competitive programming progress across platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. It offers a personalized dashboard, aggregated statistics, a friend leaderboard, and secure user authentication ‚Äî all with clean UX and informative feedback.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)
* **Authentication**: JWT + HTTP-only cookies
* **Hosting**:

  * Frontend: Vercel
  * Backend: Render

---

## Limitations

* No platform-level authentication due to lack of official OAuth or APIs from LeetCode and Codeforces
* Currently supports only LeetCode and Codeforces
* No "unfriend" or "remove platform" feature (by design decision)

---

## Future Improvements (Optional)

* Add support for CodeChef, AtCoder, etc. (if reliable APIs become available)
* Platform-level fallback so one failure doesn't break the entire dashboard
* Improved responsive design and dark mode
* User profile customization
